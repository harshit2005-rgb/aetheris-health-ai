# Aetheris Health AI — Sprint Plan (v2.0)

**Living document. Owner: Sanjeev + tech lead. Updated at the end of every sprint.**

This is the sprint-level view of the v2.0 roadmap. Each sprint is 2 weeks. Build phase runs from **Jul 28 through Nov 30, 2026** — 9 sprints.

---

## Sprint Cadence

- **Length:** 2 weeks, Monday to Sunday
- **Planning:** Monday morning of sprint start
- **Standup:** daily, 15 min
- **Mid-sprint check:** Friday of week 1
- **Sprint review + retro:** Friday of week 2 (afternoon)
- **Demo:** Every sprint review includes a working demo of what was built

**Cardinal rule:** every sprint ends with something deployable to staging. No two-sprint features. If a feature can't fit in a sprint, break it into pieces that can.

## Sprint 0 — Foundation (Jul 28 – Aug 9)

**Goal:** Nothing user-visible. Everything else in the plan depends on this being solid.

### Backend
- Monorepo layout finalized per `09-PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`
- FastAPI skeleton with health checks (`/healthz`, `/readyz`, `/version`)
- SQLAlchemy + Alembic set up; first migration
- Base `Repository`, `Service`, `DI Container` classes
- Structured logging (JSON logs, request IDs)
- Error handling framework (custom exceptions → standard error responses)
- API versioning routing (`/api/v1/`)
- Response envelope wrapper
- Config management (`app/core/config.py` with Pydantic Settings)
- pytest scaffolding, factories/fixtures base

### Frontend
- Vite + React + TypeScript project
- Tailwind + Shadcn UI installed
- React Router set up
- React Query configured
- Base layout, theme, design tokens
- API client with response envelope handling
- Auth context skeleton (no logic yet)

### Infra
- `docker-compose.yml` with Postgres, Redis, backend, frontend, mailhog
- GitHub Actions CI: lint, typecheck, tests, build
- `Makefile` targets (per user preference: no shell scripts)
- Pre-commit hooks
- Env var management (`.env.example`, secrets in vault later)

### Deliverable
- `make up` starts the full stack locally
- Hitting `http://localhost:8000/healthz` returns 200
- Frontend loads a blank shell at `http://localhost:5173`
- CI passes on main

### Owners
- Backend infra: _[assign]_
- Frontend infra: _[assign]_
- CI/CD: _[assign]_

### Risks
- Team learning curve on new architecture (expect Sprint 0 to feel slow)
- Docker networking issues on team member laptops (address in daily standup)

## Pre-Agreed Cut List

**If we slip and have to cut scope, cut in this order** (top first). This is agreed by co-founders now so the decision isn't argued in the middle of Sprint 7 at 2am.

1. **AI-generated natural language dashboard summary** (defer to v2.1) — dashboards work without it
2. **RAG (AI Milestone 4)** (defer to v2.1) — Chat + Function Calling + Memory is still a strong AI story
3. **SMS notifications** — already deferred to v2.1
4. **AI slot recommendation in Appointments** — manual booking still works fine
5. **Report PDF export** — CSV export still works, PDF can wait
6. **MFA (TOTP)** — password + lockout is still secure enough for pilot; MFA becomes v2.1

**Do not cut:**
- Multi-tenant isolation
- Audit logging
- API versioning
- Any security measure
- Any of the 4 E2E workflows
- Billing correctness (money must be right)

---

## Sprint Retrospective Template

At the end of each sprint retro, capture:

1. **Delivered:** what actually shipped vs planned
2. **Slipped:** what didn't ship and why
3. **Cut:** anything moved to the cut list
4. **Metrics:** velocity, bug count, test coverage, performance benchmarks
5. **Team:** blockers, morale, tooling issues
6. **Next sprint carryover:** items rolling forward
