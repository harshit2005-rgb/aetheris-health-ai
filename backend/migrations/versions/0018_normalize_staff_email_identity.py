"""normalize staff email identity

Revision ID: 0018
Revises: 0017
Create Date: 2026-10-06 22:00:00.000000

Makes a staff email name exactly one live account on the platform.

Login takes an email and no hospital, so the lookup is platform-wide — but the
only uniqueness rule was per hospital and case-sensitive
(``uq_users_hospital_email``). The same address could therefore exist at two
hospitals, or twice in one hospital in different case, and login could not
tell which account was meant.

This migration:

1. checks that the change can be made, and stops if it cannot;
2. lower-cases the email of every live (non-deleted) user;
3. adds ``uq_users_email_normalized_active`` — a unique index on
   ``lower(email)`` over live users.

**It refuses to run, changing nothing, if existing data conflicts.** Two kinds
of conflict are detected up front:

- two or more live users whose emails are equal once lower-cased;
- a live user whose lower-cased email is already held by another row of the
  same hospital — in practice a soft-deleted one — which the older
  per-hospital constraint would reject.

It does not pick a winner, merge, rename or delete anyone. Resolving a
conflict is a decision about real people's accounts and belongs to an
operator. The error lists the affected user ids — never the addresses.

The check, the update and the index run in one transaction, so a failure at
any point leaves the database exactly as it was.

``uq_users_hospital_email`` is kept. It is no longer the identity rule, but it
still covers soft-deleted rows, which the new partial index deliberately
leaves out. Soft-deleted users are not touched: their stored address keeps its
original case and does not occupy the platform-wide index.

``downgrade`` drops the index. It does not restore the original letter case —
that information is not kept, and nothing depends on it.
