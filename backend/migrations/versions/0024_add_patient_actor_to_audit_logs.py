"""add patient actor to audit logs

Revision ID: 0024
Revises: 0023
Create Date: 2026-10-07 10:30:00.000000

Adds ``audit_logs.patient_account_id``.

Until now an audit row could name only a staff user (``actor_user_id``) or
nobody, and an event with no user was recorded as the system. A Patient App
action is neither: a patient is not a ``users`` row and must not be recorded
as the system, or "who did this" could not be answered for any of them
(``docs/modules/15-patient-app.md`` §20.2). Such a row now has
``actor_type = 'patient'`` — the column is free text and needs no change —
and names the patient account here.

The column is nullable and is NULL on every existing row and on every staff
and system event: nothing about them changes. Like ``actor_user_id`` it is not
a foreign key: the trail is append-only and must outlive what it describes.

``audit_logs.hospital_id`` was already nullable (platform events), which is
what a patient signing in before any hospital is involved needs.

``downgrade`` drops the index and the column. Patient events stay in the
table but no longer say which account acted.
