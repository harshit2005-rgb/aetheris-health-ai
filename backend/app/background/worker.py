"""Arq worker definition — the process that runs scheduled backend jobs.

Run with ``make worker`` (``arq app.background.worker.WorkerSettings``).

Arq rather than Celery because the stack is async end to end
(``backend/CLAUDE.md`` sanctions either): Celery would need a sync bridge
around every ``AsyncSession``, and the Redis connection Arq brokers over is
already configured as :attr:`~app.core.config.Settings.REDIS_URL`.

**This process is separate from the API.** It opens its own database sessions
and does not share the request-scoped ones, so a long sweep cannot hold a
connection the web workers need.
