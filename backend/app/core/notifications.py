"""Notification seam.

``docs/modules/11-notifications.md`` §5 has every module emit an event that
the Notifications module turns into messages. This file defines the
*interface* a service emits against, in the same way :mod:`app.core.audit`
defines the audit one: services depend on :class:`Notifier`, never on
``NotificationService``, so a module can say "tell the approvers" without
importing anything from Notifications or knowing who the approvers are.

Usage::

    from app.core.notifications import NotificationRequest, Notifier

    await notifier.notify(
        NotificationRequest(
            kind="billing.discount_approval_requested",
            hospital_id=hospital_id,
            recipient_permission="invoice.approve_discount",
            variables={"patient_name": "Ananya Rao", "discount_amount": "200.00"},
            link="/billing",
        )
    )
