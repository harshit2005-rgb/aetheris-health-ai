"""Per-hospital feature flags.

Flags live as flat ``feature.*`` keys in the ``hospitals.settings`` JSONB. This
module is the single definition of each key and of what "on" means, so the
service that gates a feature and the route that reports it cannot disagree.

A flag is on only when the stored value is exactly ``True``. A string
``"false"`` or the number ``1`` is not on: a truthiness test would switch a
gated feature on for a hospital whose row merely holds an unexpected value.
