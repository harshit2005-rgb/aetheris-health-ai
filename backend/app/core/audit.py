"""Audit recording seam.

CLAUDE.md rule 9 requires every mutating operation to produce an audit entry,
and ``docs/03-ARCHITECTURE.md`` §15 rule 10 repeats it. The durable
``audit_logs`` table and ``AuditService`` are owned by the Audit Logs module
(``docs/modules/12-audit-logs.md``) and do not exist yet.

This module defines the *interface* services record against, plus a structlog
implementation to use until the durable one lands. Services depend on
:class:`AuditSink`, never on a concrete implementation, so the audit module can
drop in its own without touching a single service.

Logs and audit entries are related but different (``docs/03-ARCHITECTURE.md``
§11): logs are observability, audit is compliance. Until the compliance store
exists, this writes to the observability stream — with values stripped.

Usage::

    from app.core.audit import AuditEvent, AuditSink, StructlogAuditSink

    sink: AuditSink = StructlogAuditSink()
    await sink.record(AuditEvent(action="patient.created", ...))
