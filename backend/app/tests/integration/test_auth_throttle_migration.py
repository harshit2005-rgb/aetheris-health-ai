"""Migrations 0019 and 0020 — throttle buckets and trusted devices.

Run against scratch databases that each test creates and drops (the harness in
``test_staff_email_migration.py``). They check that the tables the models
describe are the tables the migrations build, that they come and go cleanly,
and that the old lockout columns — and whatever they hold — are left alone.
