"""Integration tests for the Billing module.

Real database, real repositories, real services — only the audit sink is a
double (``docs/11-TESTING_STRATEGY.md`` §2.4).

Two halves:

- **The workflow** ``docs/modules/06-billing.md`` §16 asks for: appointment
  complete → invoice draft → issue → payment → status transitions. It runs
  through the *real* appointment service wired to the *real* billing sink, the
  same wiring ``app/api/dependencies/services.py`` ships.
- **The races** §14 describes, run as genuinely separate, really-committing
  transactions: two payments that together overpay, a retried payment, and a
  burst of concurrent issues. These are the guarantees that rest on row locks
  and unique indexes, so nothing short of a real database can test them.
