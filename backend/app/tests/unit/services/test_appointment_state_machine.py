"""Unit tests for the appointment state machine.

Module spec §16 asks for the transition rules to be tested directly, and AC-3
requires that status can only follow the defined machine. These assert against
:data:`~app.services.appointment_service.ALLOWED_TRANSITIONS` and the service
method that reads it, with no database.

Every ordered pair of states is covered: the parametrised test below enumerates
all 36 combinations and checks each against the spec's diagram, so a transition
silently added or removed fails here rather than in production.
