"""Business logic for invoices and payments.

Owns the invoice lifecycle (``docs/modules/06-billing.md`` §5), the money rules
(§4), the transaction boundary, and an audit record per mutation (CLAUDE.md
rule 9). Returns DTOs, never ORM models.

**Financial truth is computed here and nowhere else.** Line totals and invoice
totals come from :mod:`app.utils.invoice_math`; no request carries a total, and
no client-supplied figure reaches a stored amount (business rule 7).

**Every change to an invoice starts by locking its row.** Issue, void, edit and
payment all go through
:meth:`~app.repositories.invoice_repository.InvoiceRepository.get_invoice_for_update`,
so two requests acting on one invoice run one after the other. That is what
stops two payments from both reading the same balance and together overpaying
(business rule 9), and two tabs from both issuing the same draft (§14).

**Locks are always taken in the same order** — the invoice, then the hospital's
number counter — so two issues can never wait on each other.

**The number is allocated inside the issuing transaction.** If the issue fails
for any reason, the counter increment rolls back with it and the next issue
reuses the number. That is what makes the series gap-free rather than merely
unique (business rule 2, AC-2).

**Two role rules narrow what a caller may do** (spec §3), and both are
enforced here rather than in the routes:

- *Own visits.* A caller holding only ``invoice.read.own`` — a doctor — sees
  the invoices for appointments where they are the doctor, and nothing else.
  An invoice outside that set is reported as not found, exactly like one in
  another hospital, so the scope does not reveal what it hides.
- *Cash only.* A caller holding only ``invoice.payment.record.cash`` — a
  receptionist — may record cash and no other method.

The routes decide *which* rule applies, from the caller's permissions; the
service applies it.

**Discounts are checked against a threshold the hospital sets** (§5.2,
business rule 5). A discount above it marks the draft as awaiting approval,
and the draft cannot be issued until an admin approves it (AC-4). Changing the
discount or the lines afterwards withdraws an approval already given: what was
approved was a specific discount on a specific bill.

**Refunds never rewrite what was received** (§5.5). ``amount_paid`` stays as
it was and ``amount_refunded`` grows beside it, capped by the database at
``amount_paid`` (business rule 10). A full refund closes the invoice as
``refunded``; a partial one leaves its status alone.
