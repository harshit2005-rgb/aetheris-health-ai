"""Business logic for the Doctor Management module.

Owns every rule in ``docs/modules/04-doctor-management.md`` §4, the transaction
boundary for doctor writes (``docs/03-ARCHITECTURE.md`` §9), and the audit
record for every mutation (CLAUDE.md rule 9). Returns Pydantic DTOs, never ORM
models.

**Slot generation is a pure function.** :func:`generate_slots` takes availability,
leaves, booked intervals and a timezone, and returns slots. It touches no
database and no clock, which is what makes the DST case in module spec §14 and
AC-2 testable without fixtures. The service's job is to gather those four
inputs and hand them over.

**The appointments seam.** Business rule 4 subtracts booked appointments from
generated slots, and FR-5 blocks deleting a doctor with future appointments —
both need a module that does not exist yet. :class:`BookedIntervalSource` is the
interface; :class:`NullBookedIntervalSource` answers "nothing booked" until
Appointment Management supplies a real one. Identical in shape to the
``DepartmentUsageSource`` this module now *implements* for Departments, and to
:class:`~app.core.audit.AuditSink`.

    booked: list[BookedInterval],
    timezone: str,
) -> list[SlotResponse]:
    """Compute one day's slots for a doctor (module spec §5.4).

    A pure function: no database, no clock, no ``self``. Everything it needs
    arrives as an argument, which is what lets the DST and boundary cases be
    tested exhaustively without fixtures.

    The algorithm, per business rule 4:

    1. Take each availability window for the target date's local weekday.
    2. Walk it in ``slot_duration`` steps, building each boundary as a
       *wall-clock* time in ``timezone`` and letting the zone resolve it to an
       instant.
    3. Drop a trailing partial slot — a 20-minute remainder in a 30-minute
       schedule is not bookable.
    4. Mark the slot ``on_leave`` if it intersects a leave, ``booked`` if it
       intersects an appointment, otherwise ``available``.

    **Why wall-clock rather than adding timedeltas to an instant.** On a DST
    transition the two differ. Adding 30 minutes repeatedly to a UTC instant
    walks straight through the discontinuity and produces slots at local times
    the clinic never has. Constructing each boundary as a local wall-clock time
    instead means the day has the number of real hours the wall clock says it
    has — which is what a receptionist reading the schedule expects
    (module spec §14).

    The two DST directions behave differently, both deliberately:

    *Spring forward* — an hour of wall-clock does not exist. In Europe/London
    on 2026-03-29 the clock goes 01:00 GMT straight to 02:00 BST, so a nominal
    01:00–02:00 slot spans zero real seconds. Those slots are dropped: they
    cannot host an appointment, and offering one would let reception book into
    a minute that never happens.

    *Fall back* — an hour of wall-clock happens twice. On 2026-10-25 the
    nominal 01:00–02:00 slot spans 120 real minutes, because the wall clock
    covers both passes. It is emitted as a single slot rather than split in
    two. That is a deliberate MVP simplification: it never double-books (one
    slot still takes one appointment), it just leaves the doctor with slack.
    Splitting the ambiguous hour into two distinct bookable slots needs
    ``fold``-aware handling and is deferred — see the note in the module spec
    §14 follow-ups.

    Leave and booking overlap use half-open intervals: a slot ending exactly
    when a leave begins is unaffected.

    :param target_date: The local date to generate for.
    :param availability: ``(start_time, end_time, slot_duration_minutes)``
