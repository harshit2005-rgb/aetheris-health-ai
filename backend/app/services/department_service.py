"""Business logic for the Department module.

Owns every department business rule from
``docs/modules/14-hospital-settings.md`` §4 (rules 11–14), the transaction
boundary for department writes (``docs/03-ARCHITECTURE.md`` §9), and the audit
record for every mutation (CLAUDE.md rule 9).

Returns Pydantic DTOs, never ORM models (``docs/03-ARCHITECTURE.md`` §15,
rule 7).

**Tenancy.** Every public method takes ``hospital_id`` and passes it to the
repository. A caller that supplies the wrong one gets nothing back rather than
another tenant's data, because the filter is applied in SQL.

**The doctors seam.** Rule 13 forbids deactivating a department that still has
active doctors assigned, but the Doctor Management module does not exist yet.
:class:`DepartmentUsageSource` is the interface that answers "how many active
doctors are assigned to this department"; :class:`NullDepartmentUsageSource`
answers zero until Doctor Management supplies a real implementation. The guard
and its tests ship now, so the Doctors PR swaps one DI provider and changes no
service code. This mirrors how :class:`~app.core.audit.AuditSink` stands in for
the not-yet-built Audit Logs module.
