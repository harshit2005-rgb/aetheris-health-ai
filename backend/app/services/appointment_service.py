"""Business logic for the Appointment Management module.

Owns the state machine (``docs/modules/05-appointment-management.md`` §5.1),
booking validation (§5.2), the transaction boundary, and an audit record per
mutation (CLAUDE.md rule 9). Returns DTOs, never ORM models.

**The state machine is data, not control flow.** :data:`ALLOWED_TRANSITIONS`
declares every legal move once; :meth:`AppointmentService._transition` is the
only place a status changes, and it always writes the history row business
rule 7 requires. Scattering ``if status == ...`` through six endpoints is how
an illegal transition eventually slips through.

**Overlap is guarded twice, deliberately.** The service checks first so the
common case gets a clear 409 naming the clash; the ``no_overlap_per_doctor``
exclusion constraint then makes the guarantee real. Only the database can
settle two receptionists booking the same slot concurrently (§14), because both
transactions read before either writes.

**Seams.** ``InvoiceDraftSink`` stands in for Billing (§5.6 step 6) until that
module exists — the same pattern ``AuditSink`` and ``DepartmentUsageSource``
use. Notification delivery is explicitly out of scope (§2).
