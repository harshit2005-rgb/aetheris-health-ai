"""Business logic for the Notifications module.

Three jobs (``docs/modules/11-notifications.md`` §5):

1. **Turn an event into notifications.** :meth:`NotificationService.notify`
   resolves who should hear about it, consults each person's preferences, and
   writes the in-app notification and — where wanted — a queued email. It
   runs inside the *caller's* transaction and never commits, so a
   notification exists if and only if the thing it is about was committed.
2. **Serve the notification centre** — list, unread count, mark read,
   preferences, broadcast.
3. **Drain the email queue.** :meth:`NotificationService.deliver_due_emails`
   is what the background worker calls.

**In-app delivery cannot fail** (business rule 4): writing the row is
delivering it. **Email can**, so it is queued and retried with exponential
backoff for up to five attempts (rule 3), and every email ends as ``sent`` or
as ``failed`` with a reason — never silently dropped (§7).

**A token never outlives its email.** Invitation and reset emails carry a
single-use token. It is rendered only into the queued delivery's body, which is
cleared the moment the delivery is sent or gives up. The in-app notification
never contains it.

        :param sender: The mail transport, or ``None`` if email is switched off.
        :param now: The current instant. Defaults to now; a parameter so tests
