"""The per-hospital booking policy a patient is held to (``docs/modules/15-patient-app.md`` §13.1, rule 7).

Read from ``hospitals.settings`` — the column meant for "feature flags, hours,
policies" — under flat keys, as the Patient App flag is. Each value is used
only when it is an integer within its bounds; anything else, including a
missing key, means the documented default. A hospital cannot switch the policy
off by storing nonsense in it.

Availability (Task 31) reads it to decide which slots are worth showing;
booking (Task 32) reads the same object to decide what may be booked, so the
two can never disagree.
