"""The one way an authenticated patient account becomes a patient at a hospital.

``docs/modules/15-patient-app.md`` §5.7 and §6. Staff authorization is role →
permission. Patient authorization is different in kind — **scope = self** —
and it is decided here, in one place, for every request:

1. the account has accepted the required policies;
2. the hospital is active and has the Patient App switched on;
3. the account holds an active ``self`` link at that hospital;
4. the link is honoured right now (the phone-binding rule, below);
5. the record-link consent for that hospital is in force.

The result is a :class:`PatientContext` — ``(account_id, hospital_id,
patient_id)`` — in which the hospital and the patient both come from the
server's own link row. A record endpoint asks for a context and uses nothing
else; it never reads a ``patient_id`` from a request and never implements
ownership or consent logic of its own.

**The phone-binding rule (§4.4).** A link is honoured only while the linked
record is active and its phone equals the account's verified phone. It is
evaluated on every resolution, from the record as it is now, and never stored
— so when a hospital corrects a phone number, or a number is recycled to a
stranger, the link stops being honoured at the next request without anyone
having to remember to end it.

Every failure before step 5 is the same ``404``: the answer does not say
whether the hospital exists, whether it holds a record for that phone, or
whether a link was ever made.
