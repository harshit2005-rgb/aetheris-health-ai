"""DTOs for patient appointment booking (``docs/modules/15-patient-app.md`` §9.1, §13).

The request names a slot and nothing else: there is no patient, hospital or
doctor field to supply, and any field not listed here is refused. The response
is what the patient may see of their own appointment — never reception notes,
``created_by``, or anything of another patient.
