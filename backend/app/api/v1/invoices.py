"""Invoice and payment API routes.

Implements the invoice endpoints in ``docs/modules/06-billing.md`` §9 that this
sprint covers. Routes parse input, delegate to
:class:`~app.services.billing_service.BillingService`, and wrap the result in
the standard envelope. No business logic, no database access.

**Tenancy.** ``hospital_id`` always comes from the authenticated user.

**Permissions.** Every endpoint declares one from §10. Issue, void and payment
each carry their own code, so someone who may take a payment cannot also void
an invoice.

**Narrower codes.** Reading and paying each have a narrower sibling
(module spec §3): ``invoice.read.own`` limits a doctor to the invoices for
their own visits, and ``invoice.payment.record.cash`` limits a receptionist to
cash. Those endpoints accept either code; the route works out which the caller
holds and tells the service, which applies the limit.

**Idempotency.** ``POST /invoices/{id}/payments`` requires an
``Idempotency-Key`` header (business rule 6). A retry with the same key returns
the original payment and ``200`` rather than recording a second one.

**Idempotency.** ``POST /invoices/{id}/payments`` and
``POST /invoices/{id}/refund`` require an ``Idempotency-Key`` header.

**Not here yet.** ``pdf`` and ``ai-explain`` from §9 are not implemented;
calling them is a 404.
