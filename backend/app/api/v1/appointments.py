"""Appointment Management API routes.

Implements the endpoint set in ``docs/modules/05-appointment-management.md`` §9.
Routes parse input, delegate to
:class:`~app.services.appointment_service.AppointmentService`, and wrap the
result in the standard envelope. No business logic, no database access.

**Tenancy.** ``hospital_id`` always comes from the authenticated user.

**Permissions.** Every endpoint declares one from §10. The lifecycle
transitions each carry their own code, so a nurse who may check patients in
cannot also complete a consultation.

**Idempotency.** ``POST /appointments`` requires an ``Idempotency-Key`` header
(business rule 8). A retry with the same key returns the original appointment
and ``200`` rather than creating a second booking.
