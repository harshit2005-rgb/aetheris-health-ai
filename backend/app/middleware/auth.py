"""Authentication middleware.

Extracts and validates the JWT access token from the ``Authorization`` header
and places the caller's *identity* on ``request.state`` for downstream
middleware.

**This is not the authorization boundary.** It resolves identity cheaply and
never rejects a request: an absent, malformed, or expired token simply leaves
``request.state.user_id`` as ``None``. Enforcement stays at the route level in
``app.api.dependencies.auth`` — ``get_current_user`` re-verifies the token,
loads the user, and checks account status against the database, and
``require_permission`` checks the permission code
(``docs/03-ARCHITECTURE.md`` §4.2).

Two consumers rely on the state this sets:

* :mod:`app.middleware.rate_limit` — to bill a request to a user and a hospital
  rather than to a shared client IP (``docs/06-API_STANDARDS.md`` §15).
* :mod:`app.middleware.logging` — to correlate a request with its actor.

Deliberately no database access. This runs on *every* request including
unauthenticated and public ones, so it decodes the signed token and stops
there; a per-request user lookup here would double the query cost of the API
and duplicate what ``get_current_user`` already does.
