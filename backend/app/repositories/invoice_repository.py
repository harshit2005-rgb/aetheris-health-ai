"""Repository for the invoice aggregate.

Data access only: no business rules, no HTTP exceptions, ORM models out
(``docs/03-ARCHITECTURE.md`` §4.4). Every method takes ``hospital_id`` and
filters on it, including lines and payments (CLAUDE.md rules 4 and 5).

Covers ``invoices``, ``invoice_items``, ``payments`` and ``refunds`` because
lines, payments and refunds are never addressed except through their invoice — they are one
consistency boundary. A payment and the ``amount_paid`` it changes must be
written together, under one lock.
