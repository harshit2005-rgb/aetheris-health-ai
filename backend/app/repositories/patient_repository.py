"""Repository for the :class:`~app.models.patient.Patient` model.

Data access only — no business rules, no HTTP exceptions, ORM models out
(``docs/03-ARCHITECTURE.md`` §4.4). Every method takes ``hospital_id`` and
filters on it: multi-tenant isolation is enforced on the way into the database,
never assumed from the caller (CLAUDE.md rule 5).

.. note::

   ``backend/CLAUDE.md`` describes a base repository that injects
   ``hospital_id`` automatically from ``app/core/tenancy.py``. Neither exists
   yet, so scoping is passed explicitly here — the same pattern
   :class:`~app.repositories.user_repository.UserRepository` already uses. When
   ``tenancy.py`` lands, these signatures collapse to implicit scoping.
