Data access only: no business rules, no HTTP exceptions, ORM models out
(``docs/03-ARCHITECTURE.md`` §4.4). Every method takes ``hospital_id`` and
filters on it, including status history (CLAUDE.md rules 4 and 5).

Covers both tables because ``appointment_status_history`` is never addressed
except through its appointment — they are one consistency boundary, and a
transition plus its history row must be written together (business rule 7).
