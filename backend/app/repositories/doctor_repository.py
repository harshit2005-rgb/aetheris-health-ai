"""Repository for the doctor aggregate — profile, availability, and leaves.

Data access only: no business rules, no HTTP exceptions, ORM models out
(``docs/03-ARCHITECTURE.md`` §4.4). Every method takes ``hospital_id`` and
filters on it, including the child tables — which is why migration 0006 carries
``hospital_id`` on them (CLAUDE.md rules 4 and 5).

One repository for all three tables because they are a single aggregate rooted
at :class:`~app.models.doctor.Doctor`. Availability and leave rows are never
addressed except through their doctor, so splitting them into sibling
repositories would only tempt a service into composing what is really one
consistency boundary.
